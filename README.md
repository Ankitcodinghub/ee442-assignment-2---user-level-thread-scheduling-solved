Submission

‚Ä¢ Send your homework compressed in an archive file with name ‚ÄúeXXXXXXX_ee442_pa2.tar.gz‚Äù, where X‚Äôs are your 7-digit student ID number. You will not get full credit if you fail to submit your work as required.

‚Ä¢ Your work will be graded on its correctness, efficiency, clarity and readability as a whole.

‚Ä¢ Comments will be graded. You should insert comments in your source code at appropriate places without including any unnecessary detail.

o Later submissions : HW will NOT be evaluated.

‚Ä¢ The homework must be written in C (not in C++ or any other language).

‚Ä¢ You should not call any external programs in your code.

‚Ä¢ Check what you upload. Do not send corrupted, wrong files or unnecessary files.

‚Ä¢ The homework is to be prepared individually. Group work is not allowed. Your code will be checked for cheating.

‚Ä¢ The design should be your original work. However, if you partially make use of a code from the Web, give proper reference to the related website in your comments. Uncited use is unacceptable.

Background:

Threads can be separated into two kinds: kernel-level threads and user-level threads. Kernel-level threads are managed and scheduled by the kernel. User-level threads are needed to be managed by the programmer and they are seen as a single-threaded process from the kernel‚Äôs point of view. The user-level threads have some advantages and disadvantages over kernel-level threads.

Advantages:

‚Ä¢ User-level threads can be implemented on operating systems which do not support threads.

‚Ä¢ Because there is no trapping in kernel, context switching is faster.

‚Ä¢ Programmer has direct control over the scheduling policy.

Disadvantages:

‚Ä¢ Blocking system calls block the entire process.

‚Ä¢ In the case of a page fault, the entire process is blocked, even if some threads might be runnable.

‚Ä¢ Because kernel sees user-level threads as a single process, they cannot take advantage of multiple CPUs.

‚Ä¢ Programmer has to make sure that threads give up the CPU voluntarily or has to implement a periodic interrupt which schedules the threads.

For this homework, you will write a program which manages user-level threads and schedules them using a preemptive scheduler of your own. You will use &lt;ucontext.h&gt; to implement user-level threads.

Description:

The threads can be in three different states: ready, running, or finished (you can omit blocked state for this homework). You will need a global array which will store thread information; you can use the following C structure for the array elements:

struct ThreadInfo { ucontext_t context; int state;

}

Implement the following functions:

initializeThread (), which initializes all global data structures for the thread. You need to define actual data structures but one constraint you have is to accommodate ucontext_t inside your structures.

createThread (), which creates a new thread. If the system is unable to create a new thread, it will return -1 and print out an error message. This function will be used for setting up a user context and associated stack. A newly created thread will be marked as READY when it is inserted into the system.

runThread (), which switches control from the main thread to one of the threads in the thread array, which also activates the timer that triggers context switches.

exitThread (), which removes the thread from the thread array (i.e. the thread does not need to run anymore).

Scheduler:

In this assignment you are going to schedule 7 threads (processors). Each process has 3 processor burst times and 3 I/O burst times.

[1st CPU][1st I/O][2nd CPU][2nd I/O][3rd CPU][3rd I/O]

We are going to assume that we have seven I/O servers (i.e. all processors can make I/O job concurrently) and a single device queue. When the 1st CPU execution is completed, the processor‚Äôs state is changed from running to I/O and does 1st I/O job. After I/O is completed, the processor returns to the device queue and waits for grabing CPU for second CPU execution.

Scheduler 1: P&amp;WF_scheduler (), which makes context switching (using swapcontext()) using a preemptive and weighted fair scheduling structure of your choice (for example you can use lottery scheduling) with a switching interval of three seconds. A context switch should take place when the associated interrupt comes every three seconds. If a thread finishes, its place in the thread array will be marked as empty and the scheduler will free the stack it has used.

Scheduler 2: SRTF_scheduler (), which implements ‚ÄúShortest Reamining Time First Scheduling‚Äù algorithm. This algorithm makes context switching with a switching interval of three seconds. A context switch should take place when the associated interrupt comes every three seconds. If a thread finishes, its place in the thread array will be marked as empty and the scheduler will free the stack it has used.

* Scheduler functions must print status of all the threads after each interrupt signal.

Each thread is required to execute a simple counter function that takes two arguments, ‚Äún‚Äù and ‚Äúi‚Äù, n being the CPU burst time for counting and i being the thread number. The function counts down starting from ‚Äún-1‚Äù down to ‚Äúzero‚Äù. With each decrement, the function prints the count value having ‚Äúi‚Äù tabs on its left. After each print, the function sleeps for 1 seconds.

In the simplest case, ‚Äún‚Äù value for each thread should be provided. ‚Äúi‚Äù values should be given in ascending order, i.e., first created thread will be given ‚Äúx=1‚Äù, second thread will be given ‚Äúx=2‚Äù, etc. Each thread‚Äôs ‚Äún‚Äù value is also a measure of the thread‚Äôs weight for using the CPU.

After creating all threads, main() function should simply wait in an infinite loop.

Specifications:

‚Ä¢ Your program should be written in C.

‚Ä¢ Using &lt;pthread.h&gt; library is not allowed.

‚Ä¢ You should compile your code with GCC (GNU Compiler Collection).

&lt;ucontext.h&gt; example:

The following code shows an example usage of some functions defined in &lt;ucontext.h&gt; header: getcontext(), makecontext(), swapcontext(). Note that in this example context switching occurs in main() function after each thread returns. In your program, it should happen in the scheduler function.

#include &lt;ucontext.h&gt;

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

#define STACK_SIZE 4096

ucontext_t c1, c2, c3;

void func1(void) { printf(‚ÄúIn func1 ‚Äú); } void func2(int arg) { printf(‚ÄúIn func2, argument = %d ‚Äú, arg); }

int main()

{ int argument = 442;

getcontext(&amp;c1); c1.uc_link = &amp;c3; c1.uc_stack.ss_sp = malloc(STACK_SIZE); c1.uc_stack.ss_size = STACK_SIZE;

makecontext(&amp;c1, (void (*)(void))func1, 0);

getcontext(&amp;c2); c2.uc_link = &amp;c3; c2.uc_stack.ss_sp = malloc(STACK_SIZE); c2.uc_stack.ss_size = STACK_SIZE; makecontext(&amp;c2, (void (*)(void))func2, 1, argument);

getcontext(&amp;c3); printf(‚ÄúSwitching to thread 1 ‚Äú); swapcontext(&amp;c3, &amp;c1); printf(‚ÄúSwitching to thread 2 ‚Äú); swapcontext(&amp;c3, &amp;c2);

printf(‚ÄúExiting ‚Äú); free(c1.uc_stack.ss_sp); free(c2.uc_stack.ss_sp); return 0; }

Expected output for the homework:

Example: Lottery Scheduler, there are 5 threads having one i/o and one processor burst ‚Äì first five arguments indicate processor bursts and the others indicate i/o bursts, switching interval is two seconds.
